title: "Rationale-Based Software Engineering"

In the course of doing some reading for a course on Engaging with Digital Research, one of
the topics we were asked to think about was the use of research based evidence in our fields 
of practice. Having worked as a software developer for about a decade (scream emoji), I started to
look up work other people had published about it. One of the books that came up was _Burge, Carroll,
McCall and Mistr√≠k's Rationale-Based Software Engineering_. Now, I like almost every software
developer I know is never quite satisfied with technical decision making in software projects.
There's always too much time pressure, or unfamiliarity with all the tools available or just 
inability to clearly communicate. The idea of **Rationale** captures what I feel I strive for in
software development. **RFC**s (Requests for Comments) and **ADR**s (Architecture Decision Records) have
been some of the tools for as the book puts it "capturing, recording and persuing rationale".

There are a lot of good ideas in the book about decision making in software project management, but
I just wanted to talk about one of the ideas that I found to be a nice theoretical-sounding
description for something that I've often felt to be true. The idea that decision making in software 
follows the **Recognition-Primed Decision Model**. 
A model described in _Klein GA (1998) Source of power: How people make decisions_ 
where the strategy is to find the first acceptable alternative. It's a nice model and explains many
behaviours like how we're able to find solutions to software problems quickly given the breath of
possible solutions but also why using analytic reasoning in software development feels so hard:
because it is explicitly not the model we're cultivating most of the time for most of the tasks we
have to do.
